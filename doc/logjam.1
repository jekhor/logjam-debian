.IX Title "logjam 1"
.TH logjam 1 "2003-04-25" "4.1.1" "LiveJournal"
.SH "NAME"
logjam \- GTK+ client for LiveJournal
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBlogjam\fR [\fI\s-1OPTIONS\s0\fR] [\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBlogjam\fR is a \s-1GTK+\s0 client for LiveJournal-based sites
such as livejournal.com.
.PP
Aside from writing entries, logjam lets you modify your
friends list, edit your previous entries, and more.
.PP
When run with no arguments (or just username option),
logjam will run in the \s-1GUI\s0 mode.
The user interface is mostly self\-explanatory, and won't be
discussed here in detail, except for a few notes below.
.SH "OPTIONS AND COMMANDS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS AND COMMANDS"
Options can be given in either short or long forms. For help on a
particular commands, type "\fBlogjam\fR \s-1COMMAND\s0 help\*(L". For example,
\&\*(R"\fBlogjam\fR grep help" will supply help about the grep command.
.Sp
.RS 4
Options:
  \fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR                   
    Show version of program.
  \fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR                     
    Say less.
   
  \fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-username\fR=\fI\s-1USERNAME\s0\fR      
    Username to operate as.
  \fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-password\fR=\fI\s-1PASSWORD\s0\fR      
    Password for the current user.
  \fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-postas\fR=\fI\s-1USERNAME\s0\fR        
    User/community to post as.
   
  \fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-file\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR              
    File to load.
  \fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-edit\fR                      
    Use default editor to edit post.
.Sp
Subcommands:
  \fBcheckfriends\fR  Efficiently check friends list for updates.
  \fBconsole\fR       Run a command on the LiveJournal console.
  \fBpost\fR          Post event immediately.
  \fBoffline\fR       Manage offline copies of your journal.
  \fBuser\fR          Manage user list.
.RE
.PP
Also, \s-1GTK+\s0 command line options (such as \-\-display) can be used.
.SH "GUI"
.IX Header "GUI"
This section describes some of the \s-1GUI\s0 features that aren't immediately
apparent.
.Sh "Check Friends"
.IX Subsection "Check Friends"
logjam can monitor your friends list and notify you when new entries
are posted there. Enable this by right-clicking on the indicator at
the bottom-left corner of the application window and selecting the
appropriate menu item. You may also configure logjam to start doing this
automatically for you when you login. When new entries are detected, the
indicator will turn red to let you know; click it to resume monitoring or
double-click it to open your browser on your friends page. Optionally,
you can have logjam open a small \*(L"floating\*(R" indicator which has some
useful \s-1GUI\s0 settings of its own.
.PP
Owners of large friends lists may prefer to be notified only after they
accumulate several new posts. You may set the threshold for this in the
Check Friends settings tab. The default is 1, that is, logjam will tell
you immediately when it detects new traffic on your friends page. There
is a small limit on the maximum threshold allowed, because this feature
is only useful with small threshold values.
.SH "STARTUP"
.IX Header "STARTUP"
When given a \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR argument, logjam will start up with an existing
file as the base for the composed entry. If the filename given is \*(L"\-\*(R",
the data will be read from standard input. Several aspects of the entry,
such as its subject field and the journal in which to post it to, can
be controlled by other options. This is useful in conjunction with the
\&\fB\-\-commandline\fR option, which causes logjam to post an entry without
going to \s-1GUI\s0 mode, allowing completely non-interactive posts. If you do
wish to interactively edit the entry, but don't want to load the \s-1GUI\s0,
use the \fB\-\-edit\fR option.
.Sh "Autosave"
.IX Subsection "Autosave"
logjam will periodically save a draft of your currently edited entry
in ~/.logjam/draft if you turn on the draft option in the Preferences
dialog. This feature is intended for crash recovery, not archiving. If
you want to keep a copy of your posts, you should use the
Entry\ >\ Save\ As menu option before submitting them. A future
version of logjam will support archiving of your journal.
.PP
Please note that when you exit the client normally, your draft is
cleared. It does not \*(L"stick\*(R" for the next invocation, as in the behavior
of some other clients.
.Sh "Checking friends from the command line"
.IX Subsection "Checking friends from the command line"
You can use logjam as a backend for a script or another application
that wishes to check the friends view. This may be useful if you
don't want to use the \s-1GUI\s0, or if you have several journals (in
conjunction with \fB\-\-username\fR). To do this, invoke logjam once with
\&\fB\-\-checkfriends=purge\fR (\fB\-rpurge\fR if you're using short options),
and then something like:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        logjam \-\-checkfriends && new\-entries\-handler
.Ve
.PP
Make sure that your script or application purges the checkfriends
status as described above once the user has acknowledged the new items,
otherwise logjam will always report there's nothing new.  You should also
pay attention to limiting your query rate, despite the fact that logjam
will refuse to flood the server with queries.  For more information,
see the messages on the command line. (To suppress these messages,
use \fB\-\-quiet\fR.)
